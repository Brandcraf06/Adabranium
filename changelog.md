**Updated for 1.20.1**

* Changed Mod ID to `adabranium` instead of `adabraniummod` (Everything will disappear if you upgrade a map modded in 1.19 to 1.20, which is not recommended.)
* Adamantium, Vibranium & Nether Armor Sets can be trimmed
* Renamed **Adamantine** Ore into **Adamantium** Ore
* Nether Stuff smithing recipes now requires 2 Nether Bricks items (one used as a template) and mining speed has been slightly increased.
