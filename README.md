Adabranium is a 1.15.2 (and soon 1.16) mod made using Fabric API.

 The mod adds powerful Marvel materials: the Vibranium from my "Nether Things" mod and the Adamantium

 

- You can find the Vibranium Ore rarely below layer 25 and the Adamantine Ore rarely below layer 16 in the overworld.

           - Theses two ores need a diamond pickaxe (or an equal level) to mine and drop, Adamantite ore takes much longer to mine.

- Vibranium and adamantine must be processed to be used :

           - You can make Vibranium Ingots with Vibranium and Obsidian

           - You can make Adamantium Ingots with Adamantine and Vibranium Ingots or with Vibranium and Obsidian

 

- You can now create powerful swords, tools and armor !

           - Vibranium tools/sword need an Obsidian Rod as a handle.

           - Adamantium tools/sword need an Adamantium Rod as a handle.

 

- Vibranium Sets are better than diamonds (and Netherite) and mine faster and make lot of damage! The durability for tools and sword is 10000.

- Adamantium Sets are the best equipment, mine faster than vibranium and do again more damage! The durability for tools and sword is 50000, Adamantium is widely known to be almost indestructible.

 

- You can melt Vibranium Ingot in a blast furnace to make Vibranium Dust

           - Vibranium Dust can make a Toughness Potion (Resistance I) in a brewing stand
