# Adabranium is a 1.16.5 mod made using Fabric API.

##### The mod adds powerful Marvel materials: the Vibranium from my "Nether Things" mod and the Adamantium

- You can find **Vibranium Ore** rarely below layer 24 and **Adamantine Ore** rarely below layer 22~ in the overworld.

  - Theses two ores need a diamond pickaxe (or an equal level) to mine and drop, Adamantine ore takes much longer to
    mine.
  - Adamantine ore never spawn incontact with air (Same as Ancient Debris in the Nether).
  
  

- Vibranium and adamantine must be processed to be used :
  - You can make Vibranium Ingots with Vibranium and Obsidian
  - You can make Adamantium Ingots with Adamantine and Vibranium Ingots or with Vibranium and Obsidian

- You can now create powerful swords, tools and armor !
  - Vibranium tools/sword need an Obsidian Rod as a handle.
  - Adamantium tools/sword need an Adamantium Rod as a handle.
  - You can also make Hammers if you have Vanilla Hammers installed
  
- Vibranium Sets are better than diamonds (and Netherite), mine faster and the sword inflict 10 attack damage. The
  durability for tools and sword is 2990.
- Adamantium Sets is the best equipment, mine faster than vibranium and the sword inflict 13 attack damage. The
  durability for tools and sword is 4280.
  

- You can melt Vibranium Ingot in a blast furnace to make Vibranium Dust
- You can find Heart Shaped Plant in jungles to obtain Heart Shaped Herb!
  - Heart Shaped Herb can make a Toughness Potion (Resistance I) in a brewing stand
  - You can make a Vibranium Soup with some Heart Shaped Herbs and a vibranium dust.
    - Vibranium Soup gives Strength II (1:00), Resistance II (1:30) and Speed II (2:30)
  

- You can also make Nether Tools, Sword and Armor
  - Nether set is an iron set upgrade that can't burn and floats on lava
  - He can be made with an iron tool/sword/armor with a Nether Brick in a Smithing Table
  - Does exactly the same damage and protects like iron but has a little greater durability and mine as fast as diamond.
  

- The Oneshotium Sword is obviously unobtainable in survival
