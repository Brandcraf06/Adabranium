                      Adabranium is a 1.16 mod made using Fabric API.

        The mod adds powerful Marvel materials: the Vibranium from my "Nether Things" mod and the Adamantium

 

- You can find the Vibranium Ore rarely below layer 20 and the Adamantine Ore rarely below layer 20~ in the overworld.

           Theses two ores need a diamond pickaxe (or an equal level) to mine and drop, Adamantite ore takes much longer to mine.
           Adamantine ore never spawn incontact with air (Same as Ancient Debris in the Nether).

- Vibranium and adamantine must be processed to be used :

         You can make Vibranium Ingots with Vibranium and Obsidian
         You can make Adamantium Ingots with Adamantine and Vibranium Ingots or with Vibranium and Obsidian

 

- You can now create powerful swords, tools and armor !

         Vibranium tools/sword need an Obsidian Rod as a handle.
         Adamantium tools/sword need an Adamantium Rod as a handle.

 
- Vibranium Sets are better than diamonds (and Netherite), mine faster and make lot of damage! The durability for tools and sword is 2990.
- Adamantium Sets is the best equipment, mine faster than vibranium and do again more damage! The durability for tools and sword is 4280.

- You can melt Vibranium in a blast furnace to make Vibranium Dust

- You can find Heart Shaped Plants in jungles to obtain Heart Shaped Herb!

         Heart Shaped Herb can make a Toughness Potion (Resistance I) in a brewing stand
         You can make a powerful Vibranium Soup with some Heart Shaped Herbs and a vibranium dust.

- You can also make Nether Tools, Sword and Armor

         Nether set is an iron set upgrade that can't burn and floats on lava
         He can be made with an iron tool/sword/armor with a Nether Brick in a Smithing Table
         Does exactly the same damage and protects like iron but has a little greater durability and mine as fast as diamond
         
- The Oneshotium Sword is obviously unobtainable in survival
